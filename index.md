Hi! I am a researcher in Causality. Currently, I am working towards a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Lübeck. My main interests lie in developing practical and efficient algorithms for causal inference and analysis. Most of my research has been about Markov equivalence classes of DAGs, which typically arise in causal discovery from observational data. For example, we discovered how to efficiently compute the size of a Markov equivalence class, a fundamental problem with quite a few interesting applications. Recently, I have also started to work on causal models with latent variables, such as maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs), and even delved into the problem of causal identification using front-door adjustment.

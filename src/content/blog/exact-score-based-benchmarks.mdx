title: 'Can Causal Discovery Work?'
description: 'By Marcel Wienöbst. This blog post compares classical causal discovery algorithms on simulated data similar to common benchmarks in the field. In contrast to the usually reported algorithms and baselines, I include an exact score-based method which shows the (at least to the author) surprisingly large algorithmic potential in causal discovery.'

#### Causal Discovery

In this example, the data used to learn the graphical structure, is purely observational (i.e., it was produced without intervening in the system, that is without experimentation). Learning the causal relations from observations can generally only be done to a limited degree, as exemplified by the well-known saying *correlation does not imply causation*. This holds even after making standard simplifying assumptions that
- the underlying causal structure is acyclic (there are no feedback loops) and
- there are no unobserved common causes.

Both assumptions are commonly violated in practice, severely complicating matters. However, for now let us assume they hold and, to simply things further, that the data is perfectly linear Gaussian (i.e., there are linear relationships between variables with additive Gaussian noise) and test the two *classical* algorithms: PC and GES. (These algorithms are included as baseline in almost all experiments for causal discovery, allowing a decent estimation.) Additionally, we consider as a further baseline an *exact* (score-based) algorithm, which outputs the causal structure which maximizes a penalized log-likelihood (BIC score). (TODO: cite). For our purposes here, this algorithm should give the best achievable results that is possible given the data at hand. 

Of course there are already many much more extensive benchmarks for causal discovery (TODO: some citations). Here, ...
